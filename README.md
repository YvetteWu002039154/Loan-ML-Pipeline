# Loan Modeling Project

This repository contains EDA, preprocessing, and model training code for predicting loan outcomes based on loan posting data.

This README documents how the training script `model_training.py` works, how to run it, and how to load the saved model artifacts.

## Files of interest
- `eda.py` - EDA and preprocessing helper (creates cleaned DataFrame, encoders, and can standardize numeric columns).
- `eda_visualization.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with exploratory plots and interactive EDA.
- `model_training.py` - Training script that trains multiple classifiers, evaluates with cross-validation, and saves artifacts in `models/`.
- `model_validation.py` - Small helper to load a saved model and run a single-row prediction for sanity checks.
- `models/` - output folder where trained models and metadata are written (saved as `.joblib` + `_metadata.json`).
- `Deployment/` - a minimal serving example (contains `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, and a `requirements.txt`) you can adapt for containerized serving or Cloud Run / Vertex AI custom container deployment.

## model_training.py â€” overview

Purpose: load raw CSV, build a preprocessing pipeline (numeric imputation + scaling, categorical one-hot encoding), train several classifiers, evaluate them with cross-validation, and save the trained artifacts.

Key behaviors:
- Loads CSV via `load_df(csv_path)` (default `loan_data.csv`).
- Builds a `ColumnTransformer` preprocessor with:
  - numeric pipeline: `SimpleImputer(strategy='median')` + `StandardScaler()`
  - categorical pipeline: `SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='MISSING')` + `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')`
- Classifiers trained: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, simple ANN (`MLPClassifier`), RandomForest.
- Evaluation: the script computes accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC (where applicable). It also runs cross-validation (StratifiedKFold) and reports mean/std for the CV scoring metric (default `f1_macro`).
- Model selection: models are ranked by cross-validation mean (or F1 if CV is unavailable) and the top model is saved as `models/best_model.joblib` with a JSON metadata file.

## What the script saves
- `models/<ModelName>.joblib` â€” the joblib artifact containing the saved pipeline (preprocessing + estimator) and metadata keys (we save the pipeline object and the `features` list).
- `models/<ModelName>_metadata.json` â€” small JSON with python & scikit-learn versions, timestamp, and features.
- `models/best_model.joblib` and `models/best_model_metadata.json` â€” the selected best model and metadata.

Why joblib: joblib is recommended for scikit-learn artifacts because it efficiently serializes NumPy arrays and supports compression.

## How to run

1. Create / activate your Python environment and install dependencies (example):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib
```

If you have uv you can also run:
```bash
    uv sync
```

2. Run training (from this project root):

```bash
python model_training.py
```

or (if you use `uv` helper):

```bash
uv run python model_training.py
```

The script will read `loan_data.csv` (or the CSV you supply) and write models into the `models/` folder.

## Load a saved model for inference

There is a helper script `model_validation.py` to sanity-check a saved model. It:

- Loads `models/best_model.joblib` (expects keys `pipeline` and `features`).
- Builds a single-row pandas DataFrame from a sample record, fills any missing features with NaN so the pipeline imputers can handle them, and reorders columns to match the trained features.
- Runs `pipeline.predict` and (if available) `pipeline.predict_proba`, then prints results.

Example usage:

```bash
python model_validation.py
```

Make sure the categorical values in your sample match training text (case/spelling). If any preprocessing was done outside the saved pipeline (not recommended), you must reproduce it prior to prediction.

## Details for deployment (Deployment/)

This repo includes a `Deployment/` folder with a minimal FastAPI app and Dockerfile to help you build a container to serve the saved pipeline. Two common options:

- Vertex AI: Ipload the trained model (model.joblib) to the Vertex AI Model Registry and deployed as an endpoint for online prediction
- Cloud Run: build and push the Docker image that uses `Deployment/app.py` (FastAPI) and `Deployment/requirements.txt`.

Quick serve locally (in the virtualenv):

```bash
pip install -r Deployment/requirements.txt
uvicorn Deployment.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

The service accepts JSON POST requests (see `Deployment/app.py`) and internally converts incoming arrays to DataFrames using the saved `features` list so the pipeline can run reliably.

## API Access

The trained Random Forest model has been deployed as a FastAPI application using Google Cloud Run.
It provides a public REST API endpoint for real-time loan approval prediction.

### How to Test

```bash
curl -X POST "https://loan-api-963580054894.us-central1.run.app/predict" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @sample_payload.json
```

```bash
https://loan-api-963580054894.us-central1.run.app/predict

### UI Page

The project includes a simple Streamlit frontend at `Deployment/frontend_page.py` that lets you interactively enter loan/person fields and call the prediction API.

You can find a deployed template in the following link:
https://loan-ml-ui-20251021v1.streamlit.app/

What it does
- Renders input widgets (sliders, selectboxes, number inputs) for the feature set used by the model.
- Sends a JSON POST to the FastAPI predict endpoint (configured via `PREDICT_URL` at the top of the file).

Where the file is
- `Deployment/frontend_page.py`

Dependencies
- The Streamlit app requires `streamlit` and `requests` (plus the usual data libs if you run locally):

```bash
python -m pip install streamlit requests
```

How to run locally (with local backend)
1. Start the FastAPI backend that serves the model (if you want local inference):

```bash
# in one terminal (activate your venv first)
uvicorn Deployment.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

2. Start the Streamlit UI (in another terminal, in project root):

```bash
python -m streamlit run Deployment/frontend_page.py
```

3. Open the browser at the URL shown by Streamlit. The app will post to the `PREDICT_URL` defined at top of `frontend_page.py` â€” update it to `http://localhost:8000/predict` if you're running the backend locally.

Quick run (no backend)
- If you only want to demo the UI without a working API, you can still run Streamlit but the predict action will fail unless `PREDICT_URL` points to a live endpoint. For a quick smoke test, set `PREDICT_URL` to a mock endpoint or comment out the POST call and print the constructed JSON instead.

Notes
- Make sure `PREDICT_URL` in `Deployment/frontend_page.py` points to the correct API (Cloud Run/Vertex or your local `uvicorn` instance).
- For production, you can serve both FastAPI and Streamlit in separate containers, or host the Streamlit UI as a static build (Streamlit sharing / Streamlit Cloud) and call the FastAPI endpoint.
